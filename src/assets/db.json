Anima, Bubbly, Relativo, and Breath come together to explore the illusions of the beliefs that live with us, playing with space and time and showcasing the reality and fiction of the dimensions in which we exist. Anima is inspired by the classic seats of modern design, distorting their reality through transparent elements that create a contrast of spaces. Bubbly draws inspiration from abstractionism, with a bubble enveloping the metal top of the table, communicating lightness and then a sense of weight. Relativo is a clock with hands of equal length that move uncoordinatedly, suggesting the non-existence of time as a measurable concept. Breath represents the movement produced by the lighting system, with a light bulb floating inside a transparent shell, creating plays of shadows and reflections that emphasize the characteristics of the space.",

It’s so natural to take the ball and throw it inside that cone: that’s the light switch. The metal ball, falling between the metal pipes, closes a low voltage circuit that will turn on the lightbulb. To turn the light back off, you have to physically lift the pipes and see the ball falling into the base, opening the circuit again and turning the bulb off.",
