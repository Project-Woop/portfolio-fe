Anima, Bubbly, Relativo, and Breath come together to explore the illusions of the beliefs that live with us, playing with space and time and showcasing the reality and fiction of the dimensions in which we exist. Anima is inspired by the classic seats of modern design, distorting their reality through transparent elements that create a contrast of spaces. Bubbly draws inspiration from abstractionism, with a bubble enveloping the metal top of the table, communicating lightness and then a sense of weight. Relativo is a clock with hands of equal length that move uncoordinatedly, suggesting the non-existence of time as a measurable concept. Breath represents the movement produced by the lighting system, with a light bulb floating inside a transparent shell, creating plays of shadows and reflections that emphasize the characteristics of the space.",

The brief required a holistic approach, pushing us to integrate high reconfigurability for both horizontal and vertical surfaces with a deep focus on user experience and robust product engineering.\n\nOur design process prioritized intuitive interaction and convenience. We engineered a system capable of single-handed accessory changes and integrated \"phase-related feedback\" to clearly communicate the machine's status. We also focused heavily on ergonomics, carefully balancing the weight for comfortable prolonged use, and developing a compact, convenient storage solution for the unit and its versatile accessories.\n\nThe final concept was a truly versatile cleaner defined by its user-centric features and a seamless, high-quality finish, which we achieved through a design-for-assembly approach with hidden screws. This project was a crucial practical experience for me in product engineering, requiring us to solve the mechanical challenges of a modular system while ensuring its overall comfort and usability.",

This project was a foundational deep-dive into balancing user-centric design with technical requirements, providing me with my first hands-on experimentation in product engineering and material considerations.\n\nThe brief centered on a specific archetype: a passionate cook living in a large home. This user values the culinary process itself, requiring high precision and a wide array of accessories for complex recipes, rather than speed. While they often cook for one, the product also needed to be sophisticated and capable enough for occasional hosting.\n\nOur solution, \"Geneva,\" is a modular, high-precision hand blender system. We engineered it for ergonomic comfort during extended use and high-torque performance. The design focuses on a seamless, robust interface between the main body and its specialized accessories, transforming a simple appliance into a versatile culinary tool that supports our user's passion for precision cooking.",

The objective was to analyze and redesign the tools used by a local artisan, Gino Macci, who crafts paper hot air balloons launched during patronal festivals in Capurso and surrounding areas as a divine tribute.\nWe developed several innovative tools to enhance his craft. \"Maccio\" is a tool designed to clean the dirty bristles of the brush used for decorations. \"Twistello\" is a brush equipped with an iris gear mechanism that allows the bristles to change density, thus adjusting precision. \"Simmetrica\" is a device capable of cutting the balloon panels by inputting only the balloon's height and the desired number of panels. \"Traccia\" is a metal tool that facilitates the creation of radial decorations. Lastly, \"WuitsAir\" is a device attached to the balloons that, upon detecting a certain altitude, opens valves to deflate the balloon for recovery.",

The interface guides the user clearly, allowing them to easily identify local businesses offering dedicated support, contact them, and stay updated on related news and events. The information architecture was structured to be intuitive, with clean flows that accomplish specific tasks, like registering for an event, in the fewest possible steps.\n\nTo guarantee this levelof usability, I implemented my own MnginzUI component library. This was a strategic decision: it allowed me to build an interface that was not only visually consistent but also natively accessible.
