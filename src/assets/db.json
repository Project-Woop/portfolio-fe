The objective was to analyze and redesign the tools used by a local artisan, Gino Macci, who crafts paper hot air balloons launched during patronal festivals in Capurso and surrounding areas as a divine tribute.\nWe developed several innovative tools to enhance his craft. \"Maccio\" is a tool designed to clean the dirty bristles of the brush used for decorations. \"Twistello\" is a brush equipped with an iris gear mechanism that allows the bristles to change density, thus adjusting precision. \"Simmetrica\" is a device capable of cutting the balloon panels by inputting only the balloon's height and the desired number of panels. \"Traccia\" is a metal tool that facilitates the creation of radial decorations. Lastly, \"WuitsAir\" is a device attached to the balloons that, upon detecting a certain altitude, opens valves to deflate the balloon for recovery.",

Anima, Bubbly, Relativo, and Breath come together to explore the illusions of the beliefs that live with us, playing with space and time and showcasing the reality and fiction of the dimensions in which we exist. Anima is inspired by the classic seats of modern design, distorting their reality through transparent elements that create a contrast of spaces. Bubbly draws inspiration from abstractionism, with a bubble enveloping the metal top of the table, communicating lightness and then a sense of weight. Relativo is a clock with hands of equal length that move uncoordinatedly, suggesting the non-existence of time as a measurable concept. Breath represents the movement produced by the lighting system, with a light bulb floating inside a transparent shell, creating plays of shadows and reflections that emphasize the characteristics of the space.",

      "description": "One of my most serious early projects is a phone with a unique design that defies market trends, making it stand out. The camera is particularly noteworthy. Instead of maximizing the number of cameras, I opted for a single sensor and utilized the phone's entire height to enhance its features. By allowing the lens to move along the phone's length, it replicates the functionality of a DSLR in a slim form factor. This concept was so innovative that Apple patented a similar technology years later.",

      "description": "In this project, I explored ways to make the back of a phone functional for gaming by incorporating a touchpad that can be used for aiming in shooter games or unlocking additional features in exclusive titles. For the rest of the redesign, I adhered closely to Razer's original design language. I shared images of the concept with numerous online magazines and influencers, and some began to speculate that this might be the actual Razer Phone 2. Based on the feedback and comments received, the concept was well-received.",

This sink features unique elements, such as two knobs—one for pressure and one for temperature—that can maintain a consistent water temperature, as well as Qi charging bases for charging devices like the Cyber Toothbrush Mk I. Additionally, the project includes a smart mirror capable of displaying the most useful information for your day.",
